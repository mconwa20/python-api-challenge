Recieved this message when completing the homework:
{
cod: 429,
message: "Your account is temporary blocked due to exceeding of requests limitation of your subscription type. Please choose the proper subscription http://openweathermap.org/price"
}

from openweathermap.

So unfortunately I couldn't do the statements after each graph and a screenshot of the heatmap.
